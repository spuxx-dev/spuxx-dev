Hey! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer and architect at Deutsche Bahn, the public railway company in Germany. I enjoy building web applications and their infrastructure, as well as thinking about ways to ensure code quality, maintainability and user experience.

In my spare time, I enjoy working with EmberJS (a great SPA framework!) and NestJS (a great backend framework!).
